# McDonald's Market Segmentation Analysis

This project performs a market segmentation analysis on customer data from McDonald's to identify and describe customer segments. The analysis is based on clustering techniques and predictive modeling.

## Project Structure

- `segmentation_analysis.py`: Python script containing the code for preprocessing, clustering, visualizations, and predictive modeling.
- `mcdonalds.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis. Ensure this file is placed in the same directory as the script.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project and how to run it.

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries before running the script:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

**How to Run**
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcdonalds-segmentation-analysis.git
cd mcdonalds-segmentation-analysis

Ensure the dataset (mcdonalds.csv) is in the same directory as the script.
Run the script:
python segmentation_analysis.py

**Outputs**

**Cluster Visualizations:**
- Heatmaps of segment characteristics.
- Boxplots showing age and visit frequency by segment.

**Segment Insights:**
- Summary statistics for customer preferences and behaviors.

**Predictive Model:**
- A decision tree visualization for predicting segment membership.

**Customization**
- Modify the clustering parameters (e.g., number of clusters) in the script for different segmentation levels.
- Extend the analysis by adding additional visualizations or advanced modeling techniques.

**Example Outputs**
- Heatmap of Segment Characteristics
- Decision Tree for Segment Prediction
